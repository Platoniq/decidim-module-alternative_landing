This module provides alternative and additional content blocks for the Decidim Homepage and Process Groups homepages.

Content Blocks are Admin-managed blocks that can be freely disposed, currently in the Homepage and in a Process Group Homepage. Probably in the future there will be more places where to place it.

With this module your Decidim instance will have access to:

- A Calendar widget for the homepage with active events in it.
- Extra info
- Alternative "Hero" style blocks, with images and text positioned in several ways (horizontal/vertical stacks, tiled, etc)
- Highlighted consultations
- Latest blog posts (with the ability to choose which ones to show)
- Upcoming meetings

We welcome PR with additional content blocks that can expand similar functionalities.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "decidim-alternative_landing", git: "https://github.com/Platoniq/decidim-module-alternative_landing"
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

Depending on your Decidim version, choose the corresponding version to ensure compatibility:

| Alternative Landing version | Compatible Decidim versions |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0.3.x                       | 0.25.x, 0.26.x              |
| 0.2.x                       | 0.24.x                      |

### Upgrade from 0.2.x to 0.3.x

As decidim renamed its `upcoming_meetings` to `upcoming_events` in the 0.25 version, if you are upgrading from an
alternative landing version prior to 0.3 you need to run a task to change the manifest name of the content blocks with
this manifest.

You just need to download and run the task below **before deploying your application to 0.25.x and above** by connecting
to the server you are going to upgrade:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Platoniq/decidim-module-alternative_landing/release/0.26-stable/lib/tasks/alternative_landing_rename_upcoming_meetings.rake -P lib/tasks
bundle exec rake alternative_landing:rename_upcoming_meetings:up
```

If you need to undo the changes made you can run:

```bash
bundle exec rake alternative_landing:rename_upcoming_meetings:down
```

## Contributing

See [Decidim](https://github.com/Platoniq/decidim-module-alternative_landing).

### Developing

To start contributing to this project, first:

- Install the basic dependencies (such as Ruby and PostgreSQL)
- Clone this repository

Decidim's main repository also provides a Docker configuration file if you
prefer to use Docker instead of installing the dependencies locally on your
machine.

You can create the development app by running the following commands after
cloning this project:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake development_app
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

Then to test how the module works in Decidim, start the development server:

```bash
$ cd development_app
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rails s
```

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add the environment variables to the root directory of the project in a file
named `.rbenv-vars`. If these are defined for the environment, you can omit
defining these in the commands shown above.

#### Code Styling

Please follow the code styling defined by the different linters that ensure we
are all talking with the same language collaborating on the same project. This
project is set to follow the same rules that Decidim itself follows.

[Rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/) linter is used for the Ruby language.

You can run the code styling checks by running the following commands from the
console:

```
$ bundle exec rubocop
```

To ease up following the style guide, you should install the plugin to your
favorite editor, such as:

- Atom - [linter-rubocop](https://atom.io/packages/linter-rubocop)
- Sublime Text - [Sublime RuboCop](https://github.com/pderichs/sublime_rubocop)
- Visual Studio Code - [Rubocop for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/misogi/vscode-ruby-rubocop)

### Testing

To run the tests run the following in the gem development path:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake test_app
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rspec
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add these environment variables to the root directory of the project in a
file named `.rbenv-vars`. In this case, you can omit defining these in the
commands shown above.

### Test code coverage

If you want to generate the code coverage report for the tests, you can use
the `SIMPLECOV=1` environment variable in the rspec command as follows:

```bash
$ SIMPLECOV=1 bundle exec rspec
```

This will generate a folder named `coverage` in the project root which contains
the code coverage report.
